Link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/
Explaination: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m-README.txt

#### 3. Tools
AWS EC2(4 instances to simulate 4 nodes: 1 Namenode,1 SecondaryNameNode, 2 Datanodes),
AWS EMR, Hadoop, Spark

#### 4. Methods
Prepare data and split it into train, test, validation datasets; Then train model and tweak the hyperparameters by grid search and find a better model with the least RMSE.There are 2 stages as following:
a. Conduct exploratory data analysis to figure out the distribution of ratings, users, movies using pyspark shell
b. Conduct movie recommendation for specific users  

#### 5. Impact
Compare advantages and disadvantages of different methods for big data project between AWS EMR, and multiple AWS EC2 instances. 

#### 6. Improvemnet
Try Apache Ambari later and rewrite the project in scala
